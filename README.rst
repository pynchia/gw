The online version of a glorious table-game. Guess W(hich) one it is.
Fantastic game for kids of age five and over.
It's built with Python 2.7 and Django 1.7
Use Django's admin interface to add users (players).
Each player plays against the computer.
The computer can either play randomly (easy mode) or making the best possible move, picking the feature with the higest number of matches on the board (hard mode).
Quite entertaining to play and to code.
Have fun!
